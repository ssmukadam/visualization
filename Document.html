			<h4>Introduction:</h4>
			<p>In nineteenth century, Cholera was a significant worldwide scourge with successive huge scope plagues in European nations. Somewhere in the range of 1848 and 1854, a progression of cholera flare-ups happened in London with enormous scope death toll. One pandemic of cholera happened around Broad (presently Broad wick Street) Street, Golden Square, in Soho, area of focal London with unhygienic businesses and lodging. Dr. Snow, an obstetrician with a premium in numerous parts of clinical science, directed spearheading examinations on cholera pestilences in which he showed that sullied water was the key source causing the illness. His exhaustive examination of a plague prompted his decision that defiled water from the Broad Street siphon was the wellspring of the sickness and, thusly, the expulsion of the handle prompted discontinuance of the pestilence. He further explored about Cholera that they were getting water from two water supply frameworks and one from the sewage debased piece of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated piece of the stream. He drew a guide of London, of Water-dispersed frameworks, he analyzed cholera cases among customers of water of two providers relying on their water consumption. Paces of disease among clients of the appropriation framework drawing debased water far surpassed the rates among those served by the organization whose water admission was from over the polluted part of the stream. This exhibit built up the objectives of the sterilization development, which created sewage waste frameworks and water refinement frameworks in urban communities and towns in the next many years, this brought about decline in cholera as well as different infections.</p>
			<h4>Design for Cholera Map Visualization:</h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 30px">
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: ;">In this project, Firstly, I have gone through the requirements of the project and gonethrough the the given datasets i.e. streets, pumps, deathdays and deathagessex files.</li>
                    <li>Next I made a analysis on how to draw all the graphs and how to start it. Took a overlook on the John Snow's map.</li>
                    <li>I used Visualization studio code and started uploading the packages and files. First I took the streets.json file and plotted the lines and displayed pumps from the pumps file, and plotted the deaths based on the gender and coordinates as given in the deaths_age_sex file, followed by streets names, warehouses and brewery.</li>
                    <li>By hovering on the timeline graph, we can see the number of deaths occurred on the particular dates on the map.</li>
                    <li>The first pie-chart shows the no. of deaths by age group. You can see the age groups, death percentage and number of deaths.</li>
                    <li>The second pie-chart shows the number of deaths by sex i.e., Male and Female.</li>
                    <li>Then analyzed the valuable information from datasets.</li>
                </ul>

			<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>In the beginning, I started doing sketches on the paper for the visualization by taking the datasets and their measures into consideration. There are correlations of the datasets. After understanding the datasets and their data, I tried to present my data in such a way that a person can easily lead a investigation on the cholera epidemic. Initial Visualization has a map, which has streets and pumps, locations of the deaths. I have used pie chart and timeline graph to analyze the correct amount of the deaths occurred in that area. You can also see the number of deaths occurred on a specific date. The brown color represents the London streets and yellow color represents the pumps in that area. Also mentioned age groups in different colors. I’ve also added Zoom-in and Zoom-out functions to the map. For the other pie chart, I have used two colors Maroon and Purple for Male and Female respectively.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Observations:</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>By observing the map, we can see that females are more affected than the male. By hovering on the first pie chart, user can be able to see the number of deaths by age group. we can see in the visualization that age group from 0 to 10 and age group greater than >80 is more affected by this incident than other age groups.
					Third, Timeline Graph which shows the death dates and number of the deaths occurred on that date. You can observe high death rate occurred in between 9th August and 10th September. Also, the highest death occurred is on 1st September.
					Then I have added the pie-charts where the user can have a clear percentage of deaths by Age group and Sex.
